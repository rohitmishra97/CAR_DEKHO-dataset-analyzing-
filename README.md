SQL + MYSQLWORKBENCH

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset of car sales from an older car selling company, covering the period from 1994 to 2023. The dataset includes detailed information about various aspects of the cars sold, enabling in-depth analysis and insights into trends and patterns over nearly three decades.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns, each representing a specific aspect of the cars sold:

Name: The make and model of the car.
Year: The year of manufacture.
Selling Price: The price at which the car was sold.
KM Driven: The total distance the car has been driven, measured in kilometers.
Fuel: The type of fuel used by the car (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric).
Seller Type: The category of the seller (e.g., Individual, Dealer).
Transmission: The type of transmission system (e.g., Manual, Automatic).
Owner: The ownership status indicating whether the car is being sold by the first, second, third owner, etc.
Mileage: The fuel efficiency of the car, typically measured in kilometers per liter (km/l).
Engine: The engine capacity of the car, measured in cubic centimeters (cc).
Max Power: The maximum power output of the car's engine, usually measured in horsepower (HP) or kilowatts (kW).
Torque: The torque produced by the car's engine, usually measured in Newton meters (Nm).
Seats: The number of seats in the car.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

Trend Analysis: Identify trends in car sales over the years, such as the popularity of certain car models, changes in selling prices, and variations in the types of fuel used.
Price Analysis: Examine factors affecting the selling prices of cars, including the impact of mileage, engine specifications, and ownership history.
Market Insights: Gain insights into the car market dynamics by analyzing the distribution of different car types, fuel types, and seller types.
Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast car prices based on historical data and relevant car features.

## Usage
This dataset can be used for various analyses, including but not limited to:

Studying the evolution of car features and preferences over time.
Analyzing the depreciation of car value based on usage and other factors.
Understanding the influence of engine specifications and fuel type on selling prices.
Developing machine learning models for predicting car prices and other outcomes.

## My SQL Project: Asking Questions
1) Read Cars data
2) Total Cars: To get a count of total records
3) The manager asked the employee How many cars will be available in 2023?
4) The manager asked the employee How many cars is available in 2020,2021,2022
5) Clint asked me to print the total of all cars by year. I don't see all the details.
6) Clint asked to car dealer agent How many diesel cars will there be in 2020
7) Clint requested a car dealer agent How many petrol cars will there be in 2020?
8) The manager told the employee to give a print All the fuel cars (petrol, diesel, and CNG) come by all year.
9) Manager said there were more than 100 cars in a given year, which year had more than 100 cars?
10) The manager said to the employee All cars count details between 2015 and 2023; we need a complete list.
